### Scraping web data in table format

We will start by loading the `rvest` package, which will help us scrape data from the web.

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(rvest)
```

The goal of this exercise is to scrape the population data from the Census website, and then clean it so that we can generate a population pyramid.

The first step is to read the html code from the website we want to scrape, using the `read_html()` function. If we want to see the html in text format, we can then use `html_text()`.

```{r}
url <- paste("http://www.census.gov/population/international/data/idb/",
	"region.php?N=%20Results%20&T=10&A=separate&RT=0&Y=2016&R=-1&C=US",
	sep="")
html <- read_html(url) # reading the html code into memory
html # not very informative
substr(html_text(html), 1, 1000) # first 1000 characters
```

To extract all the tables in the html code automatically, we use `html_table()`. Note that it returns a list of data frames, so in order to work with this dataset, we will have to subset the first element of this list.

```{r}
tab <- html_table(html)
str(tab)
pop <- tab[[1]]
```

Now let's clean the data so that we can use it for our analysis. First, I'll remove the row with the totals. (Note that I could just do `pop[-1,]`, but imagine that we run this code again one year from now and the format has changed. The approach below is more robust to such changes.)

```{r}
pop <- pop[-which(pop$Age=="Total"),]
```

Let's also change the variable names so that they're easier to work with. (R doesn't like variable names with spaces.)

```{r}
names(pop)[which(names(pop)=="Male Population")] <- "Male"
names(pop)[which(names(pop)=="Female Population")] <- "Female"
```

Finally, the other problem we need to fix is to convert the population values into a numeric format, which requires deleting the commas.

```{r}
pop$Male <- as.numeric(gsub(",", "", pop$Male))
pop$Female <- as.numeric(gsub(",", "", pop$Female))
```

The data is now clean, but we need to convert it to _long_ format if we want to use ggplot2 to generate the population pyramid. The following two approaches are equivalent:

```{r}
df <- data.frame(
	Age = rep(pop$Age, 2),
	value = c(pop$Male, pop$Female),
	Gender = rep(c("Male", "Female"), each=nrow(pop)))
head(df)

# using melt() from the reshape package
library(reshape)
df <- melt(pop, 
	id.vars="Age", measure.vars=c("Male", "Female"),
	variable_name = "Gender")
```

Finally, we need to make the population value negative for one of the two gender categories so that the population pyramid is properly displayed, and also convert the age variable into a factor so that the ordering of the categories is not alphabetical (default with ggplot2).

```{r}
df$value[df$Gender=="Male"] <- -df$value[df$Gender=="Male"]
df$Age <- factor(df$Age, levels=pop$Age)
```

Now we're ready to generate the population pyramid figure!

```{r, warning=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
p <- ggplot(df, aes(x=Age, y=value, fill=Gender))
pq <- p + geom_bar(data=df[df$Gender=="Male",], stat="identity") + 
	geom_bar(data=df[df$Gender=="Female",], stat="identity") + 	
	coord_flip() + theme_minimal() +
	theme(axis.title.x=element_blank(), axis.text.x=element_blank())
pq
```


### Scraping web data in table format: a more involved example

When there are multiple tables on the website, scraping them becomes a bit more complicated. Let's work through a common case scenario: scraping a table from Wikipedia with a list of the most populated cities in the United States.

```{r}
url <- 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_cities_by_population'
html <- read_html(url)
tables <- html_table(html, fill=TRUE)
length(tables)
```

The function now returns 62 different tables. I had to use the option `fill=TRUE` because some of the tables appear to have incomplete rows.

In this case, identifying the part of the html code that contains the table is a better approach. To do so, let's take a look at the source code of the website. In Google Chrome, go to _View_ > _Developer_ > _View Source_. All browsers should have similar options to view the source code of a website.

In the source code, search for the text of the page (e.g. _2016 rank_). Right above it you will see: `<table class="wikitable sortable" style="text-align:center">`. This is the CSS selector that contains the table. (You can also find this information by right-clicking anywhere on the table, and choosing _Inspect_).

Now that we now what we're looking for, let's use `html_nodes()` to identify all the elements of the page that have that CSS class. (Note that we need to use a dot before the name of the class to indicate it's CSS.)

```{r}
wiki <- html_nodes(html, '.wikitable')
length(wiki)
```

There are 6 tables in total, and we will extract the first one.
```{r}
pop <- html_table(wiki[[1]])
str(pop)
```

As in the previous case, we still need to clean the data before we can use it. For this particular example, let's see if this dataset provides evidence in support of [Zipf's law for population ranks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipf%27s_law).

We'll use regular expressions to remove endnotes and commas in the population numbers, and clean the variable names. (We'll come back to this later in the course.)

```{r}
pop$City <- gsub('\\[.*\\]', '', pop$City)
library(stringr)
pop$population <- as.numeric(str_replace_all(pop[,"2016\nestimate"], ",", ""))
pop$rank <- pop[,"2016\nrank"]
head(pop[,c("City", "population", "rank")])
```

Now we're ready to generate the figure:

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
p <- ggplot(pop, aes(x=rank, y=population, label=City))
pq <- p + geom_point() + geom_text(hjust=-.1, size=3) +
	scale_x_log10("log(rank)") + scale_y_log10("log(population)")
pq
```

We can also check if this distribution follows Zipf's law estimating a log-log regression.
```{r}
lm(log(rank) ~ log(population), data=pop)
```
