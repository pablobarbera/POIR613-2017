## Ideological scaling

Write code in R that help you answer the following questions. As in challenge 4, we'll be working with a dataset that contains all the tweets sent by Donald Trump, Ted Cruz, Hillary Clinton, and Bernie Sanders during the 2016 primary election campaign.

```{r}
tweets <- read.csv('../data/candidate-tweets.csv', stringsAsFactors=F)

```

Using the code we just discussed in class, train a wordscores model with the tweets by Members of Congress.

```{r}

```


Now, apply it to estimate the ideology of the presidential candidates. What do you find?

```{r}

```
