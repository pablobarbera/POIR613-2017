How well do latent-space models work when we move to countries with party competition in multiple dimensions? We will now explore this question in the context of the UK.

The file "../data/UK-follower-network.rdata" contains the matrix of users who followed at least 10 members of the UK Parliament as of mid-2015.

Load the matrix into R. What are its dimensions?

```{r}

```

Run correspondence analysis on this matrix.


```{r}


```

Explore which MPs are at the extremes of the distributions. What do you find?

```{r}


```

Given party discipline in the UK, we don't have good measures of ideology based on roll-call votes. However, we can explore how the ideology estimates are distributed within and across parties. To do so, merge the estimates with the party-MP correspondences available in "data/UK-mps-data.csv". Then, compute the aggregate ideology for MPs within each party. Replicate this for the first three dimensions. What do you find?

```{r}


```
